While loop syntax:
 While something_is_true:
  code block

in Hurdles challenge we used for loop.Now when we run code with while loop the code looks like this:

code:
def jump():
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_left()

number_of_hurdles = 6
while number_of_hurdles > 0:
    jump()
    number_of_hurdles -= 1
    #print(number_of_hurdles) #for checking purpose
