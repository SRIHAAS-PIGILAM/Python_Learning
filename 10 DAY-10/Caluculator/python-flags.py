"""In Python, the term "flags" often refers to boolean variables or values that are used to indicate a certain state or condition in a program. These flags are typically used to control the flow of the program or to make decisions based on whether a specific condition is met.

For example, imagine you're developing a program that simulates an online shopping cart. You might use flags to keep track of various states:
"""
# Example using flags in a shopping cart simulation

# Flag to indicate whether the cart is empty or not
is_cart_empty = True

# Flag to indicate whether a discount should be applied
apply_discount = False

# Flag to indicate whether the user has completed the checkout process
is_checkout_complete = False

# Logic to use the flags
if is_cart_empty:
    print("Your cart is empty. Add items to your cart!")

if apply_discount:
    print("A discount will be applied to your order.")

if is_checkout_complete:
    print("Thank you for your order. Your checkout is complete!")
else:
    print("Please complete the checkout process to finalize your order.")


"""In this example, the flags is_cart_empty, apply_discount, and is_checkout_complete are used to control different aspects of the program's behavior. Depending on the state of these flags, the program can take different actions.

Flags can be particularly useful when dealing with conditional statements, loops, and other control flow structures in your code. They help you write more dynamic and adaptable programs by allowing you to respond to different scenarios and conditions.
"""


"""Flags are essentially boolean variables that store a binary state: True or False. They are commonly used in programming to manage the flow of a program based on different conditions. By changing the values of flags, you can control which parts of your code are executed and how they behave.

Here are a few more examples of how flags can be used in Python:
"""

""""
1. **User Authentication:**
Flags can be used to indicate whether a user is authenticated or not. For example:
"""

is_authenticated = False

if is_authenticated:
    print("Welcome to your account!")
else:
    print("Please log in to access your account.")


"""
2. **Configuration Options:**
Flags can control the behavior of your program based on different configuration options. For instance:
"""
enable_logging = True

if enable_logging:
    print("Logging enabled. Recording events...")
else:
    print("Logging is turned off.")

"""
3. **Loop Control:**
Flags can be used to control the execution of loops, allowing you to break out of a loop based on a certain condition:"""

user_input = input("Do you want to continue? (y/n): ")
should_continue = user_input.lower() == 'y'

while should_continue:
    print("Looping...")
    user_input = input("Do you want to continue? (y/n): ")
    should_continue = user_input.lower() == 'y'


"""
4. **Error Handling:**
Flags can indicate whether an error occurred during a process, helping you handle errors gracefully:
"""


error_occurred = False

try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    error_occurred = True
    print("An error occurred: division by zero")

if not error_occurred:
    print("Calculation successful:", result)


"""Flags are versatile tools that can enhance the flexibility and control of your code. However, it's important to use them judiciously and keep your code clean and readable. Meaningful names for your flags and clear comments can help others understand their purpose in your codebase."""
