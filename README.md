# Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python through a Udemy course taught by Dr. Angela Yu. Here, I practice and upload Python code regularly to track my progress and share my learning with others.

## About the Course

The course I am currently taking is taught by Dr. Angela Yu, a highly skilled and experienced instructor in the field of Python programming. Her course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python, covering topics ranging from basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and file handling.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find a collection of Python code files that I have created while working on the course exercises and projects. Each file is labeled with a meaningful name and contains code related to specific topics or exercises.

## Getting Started

If you are also interested in learning Python or exploring the code in this repository, here's how you can get started:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SRIHAAS-PIGILAM/Python_learning-repo.git
   ```

3. **Explore the Code**: Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate through the code files using any text editor or Python IDE of your choice. Feel free to examine the code, run it on your machine, and make modifications as you see fit.

4. **Learn Together**: If you are also following the same course by Dr. Angela Yu or have any questions related to Python programming, feel free to reach out to me. We can learn and collaborate together, supporting each other's growth in Python.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning space, I welcome any contributions, suggestions, or improvements. If you spot any errors, have suggestions for better code implementations, or would like to provide feedback, please feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Please note that as I am still a beginner in Python, I may not be able to address all suggestions or contributions immediately, but I appreciate any input that can help me improve my coding skills.
